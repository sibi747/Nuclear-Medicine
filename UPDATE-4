As we all know nuclear medicine is a crucial part of the modern health care system. It has significantly improved the disease diagnosis.

In this term paper I will give you a conceptual classification and a brief summary of the technical fundamentals of Artificial intelligence, Possible applications are discussed on the basis of a typical work flow in medical imaging, grouped by planning, scanning, interpretation, and reporting.Then turn the main limitations of current AI techniques, such as issues with interpretability or the need for large amounts of annotated data, are briefly addressed.

\section{Abstract}
The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical imaging (including nuclear medicine imaging) has rapidly developed. Most AI applications in nuclear medicine imaging have focused on the diagnosis, treatment monitoring, and correlation analyses with pathology or specific gene mutation. 
It can also be used for image generation to shorten the time of image acquisition, reduce the dose of 
injected tracer, and enhance image quality.

This work provides an overview of the application of AI in image generation for single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) either without or with anatomical information [CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)]. This paper focused on four aspects, including imaging physics, image reconstruction, image postprocessing, and internal dosimetry. AI application in generating attenuation map, estimating scatter events, boosting image quality, and predicting internal dose map is summarized and discussed.
\section{Imaging physics}
As the two most widely used nuclear medicine imaging technologies, both PET and SPECT quantify radionuclidesâ€™ distribution in a recipient by measuring the gamma photons emitted from that recipient. In practice, gamma photons are attenuated due to tissue absorption in the recipient. The attenuation effect causes the number of photons to be less than expected and results in nonuniform deviations in the radioactive distribution due to the different attenuation paths from the tracer to the detector.
Another factor affecting image quality is scattered photons. Scattering events will cause severe artifacts and quantitative errors. The emergence of AI technology is not a complete replacement of traditional methods but rather an auxiliary means to find function mapping relationships and largely depends on the model structure, data range, and training process.
